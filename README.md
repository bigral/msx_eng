this project is attempt to put all required glue logic of msx2+ computer into small cpld device

it's assumed usage of sn74xx ICs with high than usual integration (i. g. 8bit latches /register file) in related pcb design, because they would require to much resources of cpld and main advantage cpld provide in this design is reducing pcb layout efforts but NOT replacing widely available highly integrated ICs
